# Fun with Docker and CIAO

Here are some (well, *one*) experiment in combining
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) with
[CIAO](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/). It is:

- very much an experimental set up,
- comes with no warranty,
- is poorly documented,
- is not guaranteed to be kept up to date,
- and is *not* an official product of the Chandra X-ray Center.

I am interested to know if you are interested in using CIAO in some
Docker-related setup, so please get in contact via the issues list if you want
to talk.

You may also be interested in the
[ldouchy/ciao](https://hub.docker.com/r/ldouchy/ciao/) Docker image (which I
have not used, and is also not a CXC product, but is likely to be more useful
than anything you find here).
